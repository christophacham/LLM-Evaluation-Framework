# Language Model Evaluation Document

This document outlines a structured framework for evaluating the performance of language models (LLMs) in tasks related to text generation and code writing. It includes evaluation criteria, detailed tasks, scoring criteria, and a template for comparing the performance of up to 10 models.

## Evaluation Criteria

The models will be evaluated based on the following metrics:

1. **Relevance:** How well the generated content addresses the prompt.
2. **Correctness:** For code, the absence of syntactical errors; for text, factual accuracy and logical consistency.
3. **Clarity and Readability:** The ease of understanding the output, adherence to writing or coding standards.
4. **Creativity:** The level of engagement and innovation in content generation.
5. **Efficiency:** For code, the optimization for performance.
6. **Completeness:** The thoroughness of the response in covering requested aspects.

## Text Generation Evaluation

### Tasks

- **Task 1:** Generate an article on "The Future of Renewable Energy".
- **Task 2:** Write a persuasive text on "Why Remote Work is the Future".

## Code Generation Evaluation

### Python

- **Task 1:** Parse JSON data from a file and print each item.
- **Task 2:** Fibonacci sequence generator function.

### Go

- **Task 1:** Concurrent web scraper with Go routines.
- **Task 2:** Basic CRUD operations in an HTTP request handler.

### Rust

- **Task 1:** File processing app demonstrating ownership for memory management.
- **Task 2:** Function showcasing error handling with `Result` and `Option`.

### TypeScript (Front-end)

- **Task 1:** React component to fetch and display items from an API.
- **Task 2:** Utility function for form input validation.

## Scoring Criteria

For a model to achieve a score of 4 or above, outputs must meet the following criteria for each evaluation metric:

| Metric | Score 4 Criteria |
|--------|------------------|
| **Relevance** | Directly addresses the majority of the prompt with minimal off-topic content. |
| **Correctness** | For code: No syntactical errors and performs as expected for most cases. For text: Factually accurate and logically consistent with minor errors allowed. |
| **Clarity and Readability** | Well-organized, easy to understand; adheres to writing or coding standards with minimal errors. |
| **Creativity** | Demonstrates original thought or an innovative approach; engages the reader or solves a problem uniquely. |
| **Efficiency** | For code: Optimized performance for the majority of cases without unnecessary complexity. |
| **Completeness** | Addresses all aspects of the prompt in detail without being overly verbose or omitting key information. |

## Model Performance Comparison Table

The table below provides an overview of how up to 10 different models performed across the evaluation tasks. Use this table to enter scores for each model based on the scoring criteria defined above. The scores should reflect an average across all tasks for each metric.

| Model Name | Relevance | Correctness | Clarity and Readability | Creativity | Efficiency | Completeness | Average Score |
|------------|-----------|-------------|-------------------------|------------|------------|--------------|---------------|
| Model 1    |           |             |                         |            |            |              |               |
